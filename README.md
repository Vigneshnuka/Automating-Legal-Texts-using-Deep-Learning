# Automating-Legal-Texts-using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on automating legal judgment transcription using deep learning. Texts from IndianKanoon were converted to speech using gTTS, processed to .wav with VAD, normalization, MFCC, and LPC. Models like Whisper, Vosk, and Wav2Vec 2.0 were evaluated using WER, CER, and BLEU to find the best transcription model.
